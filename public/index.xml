      <description>On august 12 2024 I will have been on this planet for 27 years, I felt like I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done much with the precious time on here and felt like i was counting down the years in my quarter life crisis. For those of you struggling with those kinds of thoughts I urge you not to feel sad or depressed.
you&amp;rsquo;ve been blessed with the gift of life and I will tell you now the secret to not worrying.</description>

      <description>After a few nights and many powdered energy drinks later, I have finally managed to get the blog section of this website fully functional!
after struggling with my ADHD not being able to get anything done for such a long time, it is such a relief to actually be able to say I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished a nice milestone in my tech endeavours thanks to the power of caffeine!
if you have access to ADHD medicine it is obviously a much better option.</description>

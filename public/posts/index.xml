      <description>After a few nights and many powdered energy drinks later, I have finally managed to get the blog section of this website fully functional!
after struggling with my ADHD not being able to get anything done for such a long time, it is such a relief to actually be able to say I&amp;rsquo;ve acomplished a nice milestone in my tech endeavours thanks to the power of caffeine!
if you have access to ADHD medicine it is obviously a much better option.</description>

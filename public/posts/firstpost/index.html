	 <p>After a few nights and many powdered energy drinks later, I have finally managed to get the blog
section of this website fully functional!</p>
<p>after struggling with my ADHD not being able to get anything done for such a long time, it
is such a relief to actually be able to say I&rsquo;ve accomplished a nice milestone in my tech
endeavours thanks to the power of caffeine!</p>
<p>if you have access to ADHD medicine it is obviously a much better option. But
in my personal experience if you&rsquo;re currently struggling  and
cannot access medicine like Adderall, it&rsquo;s always worth a shot if you don&rsquo;t have any conditions that make it a no-go.
caffeine is something that has the potential to help like it has for me.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. Never drink more than 2 caffeinated drinks a day as it&rsquo;s not good for your body when you have too much</strong></p>

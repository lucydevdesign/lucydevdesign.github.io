<p>Hi my name is lucy and welcome to my personal website.</p>
<p>my pronouns are she/her and I am a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community!</p>
<p>This site acts as my personal portfolio and a blog of my life including projects
I am currently working on.</p>
<p>In my spare time I like to tinker with tech, watch tokusatu with my friends
and girlfriend, go on morning outdoor walks and create art with a variety of mediums such as vector art and 3d.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy your stay in my little corner of the internet!</p>

		Life is like a video game

  </h1>
  <p><p>On august 12 2024 I will have been on this planet for 27 years, I felt like I hadn&rsquo;t done
much with the precious time on here and felt like i was counting down the years in my quarter life crisis. For those
of you struggling with those kinds of thoughts I urge you not to feel sad or depressed.</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been blessed with the gift of life and I will tell you now the secret to not worrying.
The secret to treat your life like a video game gain points by making yourself shown and leave your
mark in this beautiful universe!</p>
<p>Leaving an impact on this world is the greatest thing you can do and even when you&rsquo;re long
gone your time on this world can lead to great and wonderful things in the future.</p>
<p>one of my more silly goals is to prank distant ancestors (<em>or aliens who find earth</em>) by engraving silly memes into a long
lasting material that look like a historical artefact. A cosmic comedy for the ages!</p>
<p>life is a wonderful thing, treat every second with the utmost preciousness and make your
purpose to make life even more wonderful for your future descendants.</p>

  </h1>
  <p><p>After a few nights and many powdered energy drinks later, I have finally managed to get the blog
section of this website fully functional!</p>
<p>after struggling with my ADHD not being able to get anything done for such a long time, it
is such a relief to actually be able to say I&rsquo;ve accomplished a nice milestone in my tech
endeavours thanks to the power of caffeine!</p>
<p>if you have access to ADHD medicine it is obviously a much better option. But
in my personal experience if you&rsquo;re currently struggling  and
cannot access medicine like Adderall, it&rsquo;s always worth a shot if you don&rsquo;t have any conditions that make it a no-go.
caffeine is something that has the potential to help like it has for me.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. Never drink more than 2 caffeinated drinks a day as it&rsquo;s not good for your body when you have too much</strong></p>

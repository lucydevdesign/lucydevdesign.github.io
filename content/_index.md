# welcome!
Hi my name is lucy and welcome to my personal website.

my pronouns are she/her and I am a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community!

This site acts as my personal portfolio and a blog of my life including projects
I am currently working on. 

In my spare time I like to tinker with tech, watch tokusatu with my friends
and girlfriend, go on morning outdoor walks and create art with a variety of mediums such as vector art and 3d.

Hope you enjoy your stay in my little corner of the internet!

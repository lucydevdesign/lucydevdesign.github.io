On august 12 2024 I will have been on this planet for 27 years, I felt like I hadn't done
much with the precious time on here and felt like i was counting down the years. For those
of you struggling with those kinds of thoughts I urge you not to feel sad or depressed. 

you've been blessed with the gift of life and I will tell you now the secret to not worrying.
The secret to treat your life like a video game gain points by making yourself shown and leave your
mark in this beautiful universe! 

Leaving an impact on this world is the greatest thing you can do and even when you're long
gone your time on this world can lead to great and wonderful things in the future.

one of my more silly goals is to prank distant ancestors (*or aliens who find earth*) by engraving silly memes into a long
lasting material that look like a historical artefact. A cosmic comedy for the ages!

life is a wonderful thing, treat every second with the utmost preciousness and make your
purpose to make life even more wonderful for your future descendants.

After a few nights and many powdered energy drinks later, I have finally managed to get the blog
section of this website fully functional!

 after struggling with my ADHD not being able to get anything done for such a long time, it 
 is such a relief to actually be able to say I've acomplished a nice milestone in my tech
 endeavours thanks to the power of caffeine!
 
 if you have access to ADHD medicine it is obviously a much better option. But
 in my personal experience if you're currently struggling  and
 cannot access medicine like Adderall, it's always worth a shot if you don't have any conditions that make it a no-go. 
 caffeine is something that has the potential to help like it has for me.
 
 **P.S. Never drink more than 2 caffeinated drinks a day as it's not good for your body when you have too much**
